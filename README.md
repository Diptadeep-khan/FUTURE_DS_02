📌 Summary of Common Issues:
Top issue subjects: e.g., "Login Problem", "Account Access", "Payment Failed".
Keywords in descriptions: e.g., “password”, “invoice”, “setup”.

⏱️ Response & Resolution Insights:
Slowest Response Channel: e.g., Social Media — avg 36 hrs
Fastest Channel: e.g., Chat — avg 6 hrs
High Priority Tickets have longer resolution times, possibly due to complexity.

✅ Recommended Improvements:
Automate first responses for low-priority tickets via chatbot to reduce backlog.
Redirect common billing issues to a self-help portal.
Train agents specifically for high-volume issues like login/access.
Prioritize tickets from slower channels (e.g., social) for faster triage.
